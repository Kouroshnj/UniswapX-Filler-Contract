# UniswapX Protocol â€“ Executor Samples

This repository contains a sample implementation of the **UniswapX** protocol, showcasing all valid executors in isolation.

In addition, we have added a new test called **`CustomUniversalRouterExecutor`** to handle fee collection.

## Notes
- This project is intended for educational and reference purposes.
- All code samples are kept minimal for clarity.
